CudaHoG
==========

An effieient implementation of Dalal & Triggs Histogram of Oriented Gradients [1] feature extractor in CUDA. The library is extensible, uses CImg and is written in C++11. This library also provides MATLAB bindings via MEX functions.

## Compiling
In order to compile and use the library, `git clone` the master branch and import it as a project in Eclipse (or Nsight Eclipse Edition) using (*File -> Import -> Existing Project into Worspace*). The makefiles will be automatically generated by Eclipse.

Four configurations are provided inside the Eclipse project file:
**Debug:** Executable binary file with debugging information
**Release:** Executable and optimized binary file without debugging information
**Mex:** Required library (*.so) file with debugging information. The generated file is automatically copied under `matlab` subfolder.
**Mex (Release):** Required library (*.so) file with optimizations and without the debugging information. The generated file is automatically copied under `matlab` subfolder.

##Usage
The executable usage is straightforward (example provided in the Main function). 

Mex interfaces can be created by first building with "Mex" or Mex (Release)" configuration. Then simply start MATLAB in the `matlab` directory, run `compile.m` to create the mex files. Two examples are provided: `testHOG.m` and `testBoxFilter.m`.

## Acknowledgement
This library uses [CImg](http://cimg.sourceforge.net/) for openning and reading different image formats.
